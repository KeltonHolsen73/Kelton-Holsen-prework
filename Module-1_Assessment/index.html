            <p>My name is Kelton Holsen and I am a recent graduate majoring in computer science and
            creative writing. Yes, it's an interesting combination. I pride myself on my ability to
            adapt to new circumstances using my analytical skills. In my free time, I run tabletop
            roleplaying games like <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, sing, and occasionally make mead.
            </p>
            <p>A fun fact about me is that, in the fourth grade, I was given an award by my school
                for having the most time logged on StudyIsland.com. For this accomplishment, I was given
                a men's XL StudyIsland t-shirt which I still own to this day (it still doesn't fit).
                I'm about 90% certain that it was sent to the principal by the StudyIsland people and he
                decided to give it as a prize instead. I also got to play in a live-action version of Deal
                or No Deal in which I inadvertantly turned down a $100 bill, but won 250 pieces of gum.
