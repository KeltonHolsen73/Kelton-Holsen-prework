This program is a word-guessing game based on the Cthulhu Mythos. All of the words in this pool
are things that appear in the stort stories of H.P. Lovecraft and others. Don't go insane!
(Yes, some of the words have characters other than letters. This is restricted to ' and -, but if you guess any other
character, it will still count towards your guess count, so we recommend not doing that.)

To start the game, press any key.
To play, press a key on your keyboard that corresponds to a letter that you think appears in the word. If
the letter is there, it will appear in one of the blanks on the screen. Choose carefully, as you only have
so many guesses! You win if you fill in all the letters before running out of guesses. Either way, the game will
automatically give you a new word after every round.
Note that all words, even proper nouns, are in all lowercase for this game's purposes (so you don't have to guess
if it's a proper noun).
